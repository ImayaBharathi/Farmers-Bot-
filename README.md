# Farmers-Bot-
This chatbot is developed to support and save farming .
Since farming is at the edge of saving, I have created a chatbot that support the rookie farmers to know the seasons, fertilizers, where to get them, weather update, details of crops plantation. This chatbot will be a great use to all the new people who are interested in doing farming but not ready to take the initial risk because they donâ€™t the basics of farming. This chatbot has as an advantage of guiding the farmers to have a better place to find the fertilizers and seeds. It also has the working progress of guiding the farmer to get profit by using the organic fertilizers. This can be achieved by guiding them to use the right period to plant the crop and the right manure to use. This chat bot will also be useful to the farmers too on behalf of choosing the fertilizers and also knowing the weather in their location.
